## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Adding CSS Shapes Behind Images
Creating the shape with CSS was easy, but getting it positioned correctly took some messing around to get it lined up right. I have worked with the `position` property some in the pass, but I never felt I had a strong understand of when to use `absolute` vs `relative`.

Working on this part of the project allowed me to play around with the two position values and see how that affected the layout. 

#### Working with SVGs
This was my first time working with an SVG where I needed to change the fill/stroke depending on where the images was used. I tried a few options to see how I could acutally edit the color with CSS and ended up putting the SVG tag directly in my HTML. 

This worked to accomplish my goal; however, the SVG markup is large and looks messy in my code. I will have to look into this more to see some other ways to add SVGs without making my HTML harder to read. 

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [MDN CSS Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) - Referenced this when position the CSS shapes behind images



- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
